# RasPiHome

This was my final project for my final year of vocational school. It is a replication of a smart home system using a Raspberry Pi as a Hub. The hub communicates with Arduinos, representing the controllers, in each room. A controller is connected to an arbitrary amount of sensors and actors. The hub was able to read from the sensor and control the actors via the controllers.

The system was controlled via a web interface.
